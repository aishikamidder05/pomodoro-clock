# pomodoro-clock
## This project was built as a part of Github Actions Hackathon My DEV post here

### To use it for yourself
Setup an account in Twilio and Mailgun</br>
Create the secret variables with the same names I have created</br>
Just put your own information, like api keys, phone number, email etc.</br>
Set the secret variable IS_ACTIVATED to 0 to stop receiving any alerts and set it to 1 to turn on the pomodoro clock.</br>
