# pomodoro-clock

This project was built as a part of Github Actions Hackathon [My DEV post here](https://dev.to/aishikamidder05/build-a-pomodoro-clock-using-github-actions-3fme).

## To use it for yourself

- Setup an account in **Twilio and Mailgun**.
- Create the **secret variables** with the same names I have created.
- Just put your **own** information, like api keys, phone number, email etc. 
- Set the secret variable **IS_ACTIVATED** to **0** to stop receiving any alerts and set it to **1** to turn on the pomodoro clock.
