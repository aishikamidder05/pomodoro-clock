### To use it for yourself, setup an account in Twilio and Mailgun.</br>
### Just create the secret variables with the same names I have created and put your own information, like api keys, phone number, email etc. </br>
### Set the secret variable IS_ACTIVATED to 0 to stop receiving any alerts and set it to 1 to turn on the pomodoro clock.
